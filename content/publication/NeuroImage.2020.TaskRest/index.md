abstract: "Functional connectivity – the co-activation of brain regions – forms the basis of the brain’s functional architecture. Often measured during resting-state (i.e., in a task-free setting), patterns of functional connectivity within and between brain networks change with age. These patterns are of interest to aging researchers because age differences in resting-state connectivity relate to older adults’ relative cognitive declines. Less is known about age differences in large-scale brain networks during directed tasks. Recent work in younger adults has shown that patterns of functional connectivity are highly correlated between rest and task states. Whether this finding extends to older adults remains largely unexplored. To this end, we assessed younger and older adults’ functional connectivity across the whole brain using fMRI while participants underwent resting-state or completed directed tasks (e.g., a reasoning judgement task). Resting-state and task functional connectivity were less strongly correlated in older as compared to younger adults. This age-dependent difference could be attributed to significantly lower consistency in network organization between rest and task states among older adults. Older adults had less distinct or segregated networks during resting-state. This more diffuse pattern of organization was exacerbated during directed tasks. Finally, the default mode network, often implicated in neurocognitive aging, contributed strongly to this pattern. These findings establish that age differences in functional connectivity are state-dependent, providing greater insight into the mechanisms by which aging may lead to cognitive declines."

summary: Recent work in younger adults has shown that patterns of functional connectivity are highly correlated between rest and task states. Whether this finding extends to older adults remains largely unexplored. To this end, we assessed younger and older adults’ functional connectivity across the whole brain using fMRI while participants underwent resting-state or completed directed tasks (e.g., a reasoning judgement task).
